1. A brief (3-5 sentences) description of your planned project

I would like to implement the game of Hex, an important game in the history of game theory. An argument that this game has an optimal strategy was developed by Nash [1], and the proof that this game will always terminate in a winner has been shown to be equivalent Brower's Fixed Point Theorem [2]. That theorem can be used to prove that all non-cooperative games have a Nash Equilibrium in Mixed Strategies [3]. This is the theorem that Nash is well-known for [4]. I am interested in sharing these topics, and to that end, I may build explainers, particularly using an article by Flannigan [5].

2)

The key features which will qualify as a success are the following:

a) A way to store the information in the game.

b) A way to play the game from the terminal.

c) A way to visualize the game with using a graphics library.

I plan to first implement for a one and four-tile board, this being my MVP. I will then make this work for an n^2-tile board.

Once this is achieved, there are many ways for me to further improve the project. I consider all of these ideas to be above and beyond ideas that may or may not be implemented. 

extra 1) Point and click interaction with vizualized game
extra 2) Computer opponent
extra 3 through n) Visual & interactive walkthrough of Brower's fixed point theorem inspired by [https://www.jezzamon.com/fourier/] and [https://ciechanow.ski]. For me though, this would proceed through loading applets with text printed to the console, much less elegant than the beautiful works of programmatic pedagogic art.

3 & 4. I plan to work alone this semester.
